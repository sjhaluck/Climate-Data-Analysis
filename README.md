# Project-1---Climate-Data
An initial investigation into climate data and moving averages

## Purpose and Scope
The project was an initial investigation into basic data analysis and visualization. The project compares
 climate data, globally and locally. In this case, Kansas City, MO is the closest major city and was selected
 for the local analysis data.

## Methods and Procedures
Given the data in a database, the information is filtered using SQL. The data is then downloaded to a 
spreadsheet and visually assessed for data completeness, accuracy, and consistency. With the limitations
 on the data, an appropriate period of time is selected for analysis.

To smooth the data variations, the 10-year moving-averge is calculated. The 10-year moving average is graphed 
for the local and global data. An summary analysis is completed with the visualization and comparison of the 
trends in climate data for the local and global data.
